Random Number Generator with Weights/Non-Uniform Random Number Generator

Choose the minimum,maximum, and weights of the numbers from the minimum through the maximum.
Also, choose how many numbers are printed out to test random distributions.
Print out the weights for each number.

## Applications ##
Generating a training set of events based on the probability of the events occurring.(Used for preparation to handle a set of events)

Map an event to a number such as 1 is mapped to a specific weather event.

Map a decision to a number with certain decisions having greater weight than others.

Gamify distributions with some numbers or values(in a key/value pair) being more rare.

Map objects to numbers.

## Machine Learning ##
Random and automated distributions based on designed weights.
