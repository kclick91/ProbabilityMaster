# ProbabilityMaster
***Random Number Generator with Weights/Non-Uniform Random Number Generator***

1. Choose the minimum,maximum, and weights of the numbers from the minimum through the maximum.
2. Also, choose how many numbers are printed out to test random distributions.
3. Print out the weights for each number.
4. Feed counts straight into the weight array.

## Motivation ##
The motivation for **ProbabilityMaster** was for combining design and randomization && combining control and surprise.

## Applications ##
1. Generating a training set of events based on the probability of the events occurring.(Used for preparation to handle a set of events)

2. Map an event to a number such as 1 is mapped to a specific weather event.

3. Map a decision(Financial/Learning/Exercise/etc.) to a number with certain decisions having greater weight than others.

4. Gamify distributions with some numbers or values(in a key/value pair) being more rare.

5. Map objects to numbers.

6. Form lists of distributions as if the weight array is DNA for something that is described by
each list at different instants of time.

7. Distribute focus on different areas, stages, tasks etc. of a project

## Machine Learning ##
1. Random and automated distributions based on designed weights.

2. Used for predictable weights/probabilities but unpredictable specific examples.

3. One distribution run is for one generated example.
